SurfGuru helps you catch your next wave by providing a searchable listing of the current surf conditions at popular surfing beaches around the globe. SurfGuru lists beaches and their current surf heights by location, narrowing down by continent and country of choice. 

Get specific details including water and air temperatures, swell directions, wind conditions, and ideal stats for each beach right here in the SurfGuru app, or copy/paste the beach link in your browser!
